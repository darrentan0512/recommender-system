Key Components:

Event Tracking: Records user interactions (views, clicks, purchases) in real-time
User-Item Matrix: Maintains a matrix of user interactions with items
Multiple Recommendation Strategies:

Collaborative filtering (based on similar users)
Content-based (based on item attributes)
Hybrid approach (combining both methods)
Popularity-based fallback for cold-start problems



Implementation Details:

Redis Backend: Uses Redis for fast storage and retrieval of user-item interactions
Real-time Updates: Updates user profiles and item metadata immediately after events
Time Decay: Applies decay to older interactions to prioritize recent behavior
Similarity Calculation: Finds similar users based on interaction patterns

To Deploy This System:

Set up Redis: Install and configure a Redis server
Event Integration: Integrate the track_event method with your frontend or API
Periodic Batch Updates: Schedule the batch_update_model method to run periodically
Recommendation API: Expose the get_user_recommendations method as an API endpoint
